# Mixed Messages (Fortune Cookie)

Mixed Messages is part of the Full-Stack Engineer path on Codecademy.  The purpose of this project is to practice what I have learned in javascript and gitHub to create a functioning program with version control.  For this project I am creating a virtual fortun cookie!  When you open the cookie you will get a random fortune.
